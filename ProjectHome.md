# A connection between Simulink, Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and EAST-ADL #
This work provides a bridge between MATLAB/Simulink and the EAST-ADL language, using Ecore as an intermediate format. It is programmed in JAVA, as an Eclipse plug-in, MATLAB m-files, for the MATLAB interface, and Atlas Transformation Language, for the model transformations.The target EAST-ADL environment is the reference implementation in Papyrus UML.


This work is performed by the Mechatronics group at KTH, as a part of different projects, mainly ATESST2. It is under development, and has many outstanding issues.

A good place to start is the [overview](Overview.md) page.
