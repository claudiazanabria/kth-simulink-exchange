## Limitations ##

At the time of this writing (April 2010) the following restrictions apply

  * You can only work on one side at the time, i.e. we don't have yet merging possibilities.
  * Only FunctionalAnalysisArchitecture (FAA) from EAST-ADL is converted to Simulink.
  * Behaviour implementation in Simulink is not converted to EAST-ADL. This information is kept only on the Simulink side.
